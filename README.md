# The Classification goal is to predict “heart disease” in a person with regards to different factors given.

## Context:
* Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US. At least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.
* Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. Machine learning methods may detect "patterns" from the data and can predict whether a patient is suffering from any heart disease or not.

## Details
* Models Trained: Logistic regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, GradientBoost, and Stacked Classifier.
* Predictions made on test data and steps to be taken in future in order to improve the accuracy of the model.
* Data preprocessing lab assignment. The csv file used and the solution .ipynb along with its html version are enclosed in the same and only folder in this repo "Lab3-Supervised_Learning". The 3 files enlcosed in this folder are :
  - Supervised Learning - Lab Problem Statement.html
  - Supervised Learning - Lab Problem Statement.ipynb
  - heart_2020_cleaned.csv
